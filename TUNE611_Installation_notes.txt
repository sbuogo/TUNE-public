Installation notes

TUNE executable is developed under Matlab environment and packaged as
a Windows standalone application requiring Matlab runtime v. 9.5 (R2018b). 
If not already present, runtime is freely and automatically downloaded 
from the web during installation.


1. System requirements

System requirements are the same as those for Matlab v. 9.5 (R2018b):

- Operating systems:
	Windows 10, 11
	Windows 7 Service Pack 1
	Windows Server 2016, 2012 R2, 2012
	Note: Windows 8.1 not supported

- Processors:
	Any Intel or AMD x86-64 processor, 4 cores and AVX2 support recommended

- Minimum 3 GB Disk space, SSD recommended

- Minimum 4 GB RAM, 8 GB recommended

- No graphics card required, hardware accelerated graphics card supporting
  	OpenGL 3.3 with 1 GB GPU memory recommended.


2. Installation procedure

2.1 Recommended procedure: automatic runtime web download

Launch the installer file "TUNE***_Installer_web.exe" (*** = version number)
then follow the instructions. User is prompted to select installation folders 
for executable and runtime, and to optionally add a desktop shortcut.
If Matlab full program or runtime is not present or is installed with version(s)
different than v. 9.5, this runtime is installed using a proper separate target 
folder, possibly along with the existing one(s).  The installer skips runtime install 
if Matlab runtime v. 9.5 is detected, considerably reducing installation time. 
Note that some Matlab versions later than v. 9.5 may still support v. 9.5 runtime.
Installing v. 9.5 runtime alongside with existing full installations of much earlier
Matlab versions, or highly customized installations, is unchecked and discouraged 
as conflicts may arise between the two which may lead to execution hangup.

Runtime download size is about 800 MB, which may require quite some time on slow 
connections.

2.2 Alternate procedure: manual runtime web download

Alternatively, prior to installing TUNE, download and install the Windows version 
of MATLAB Runtime v. 9.5 (R2018b) from the following link on MathWorks website:

    http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html
   
Once the runtime is correctly installed, TUNE installer may be launched even
with no web connection available to install an executable file and a desktop
shortcut. Instead of using the installer, the executable file alone might also
be copied to and launched from any folder: however, this should be done with
caution as leaving multiple copies of TUNE executable with different versions
might lead to conflicts when dealing with initialization and setup files.

"Distribute Applications" in MATLAB Compiler documentation in the MathWorks 
Documentation Center.

2.3 Alternate procedure: installer including runtime

In cases where TUNE is to be installed on a PC with no available web access, 
another installer file "TUNE***_Installer_runtime.exe" (*** = version number)
is provided which also includes and installs the required runtime. This 
installer is a totally standalone app and may be copied to and launched from
any folder on any offline PC provided that system requirements are met. 
Note that the size of this installer is quite large (about 1 GB).


3. Launching TUNE application

TUNE is started as a normal Windows application by double-clicking on it.
When starting for the first time, some additional time may be required to configure
Matlab runtime in the background, as if starting a regular full Matlab session.


4. Uninstalling/reinstalling TUNE

TUNE may be uninstalled using Windows standard system tool. Uninstalling TUNE
does not uninstall Matlab runtime, which should be done separately. Note that
the uninstall feature is only effective if TUNE has been previously installed
using the installer.

Reinstalling TUNE does not require to reinstall Matlab runtime if already present.

Existing TUNE versions should be uninstalled before installing a new one.
